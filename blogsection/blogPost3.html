        <h2>Close reading: What is Interaction for Data Visualization?</h2>
        <p>The article is concerned with defining interaction in visualisaion. The article puts an emphasis on the idea of interactivity in terms of human computer interaction trying to formulate a definition of what it would mean for a visualisation to be interactive. </p>
        <p>The article first explains its methods of obtaining data for there research going into the criteria that papers needed to meet in order to be considered as well as the information that was being looked for. The research for the article was done using a quantitive approach in order to come to the desired outcome which in this case was to define interaction in terms of visualisation in a way that is flexible and comprehensive. The article goes onto establishing key components of interaction mainly being external entities which entail the user interacting with the dat using a set of controls, internal entities with entails interaction being an action that involves a goal or intent on the part of the user, external actions which is described as “action-reaction pairs” (Dimara and Perin, 2020) which is about how the system should respond once the user acts upon it, the last component is internal actions which is about how the user then processes the data in their own mind. These key components however can be expanded upon. 

        </p>
        <p>
            The article explores the ways in which interaction or the key aspects of interaction in terms of visualisations could be somewhat unconventional and how the key components outlined allow for this sort of flexibility. For example in the concept of external entities the idea of some sort of tool or medium by which the user interacts with the data is outlined but very loosely, this allows for there to be various unconventional modes for the user to interact with the data rather than the visualisations being constrained to the typical screen, mouse and keyboard. An interesting example of this I can think of is the interactive sandbox height maps, by moving the sand around the user is presented with a height map, this is an interesting way of getting intup from the user in which te sand acts as the mediating entity offering the user an interactive data experience. 

        </p>
        <p>
            The article goes on to discuss the idea of goals and intent when it comes to interacting with a visualisation, diving into what a goal or intention can manifest as. Goals can be present at various levels and can be divided or catagories into sub levels. Goals can evolve and change over time based on previous outcomes or the amount of time the user spends interacting with the visualisation. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Further the article talks about the benefits interaction can have, this is an area that is spoken a lot about when mentioning the idea of interaction in visualisation, the main point is that interaction can allow for the user to gain a better understanding of the data as well as gain deeper and more specific insight into the data set. This outlines how interaction can be useful in the process of knowledge creation and understanding. The article highlights the issues that arise when trying to design interaction in visulisation in that there maybe a lack of flexibility when considering the questions or goals of the human user as well as the limitations and constraints of visualisation systems briefly mentioning how when designing interactions concepts like playfulness aren’t often considered or are hard to implement. Again I think the sandbox map is a good example of playfulness as it pertains to visualisation. The article also discusses how system centric visualisations can often limit or exclude the users ability to have evolving intentions and goals therefore not allowing the user to explore the data to its fullest limiting the amount of value the user can get out of the visualisation. If a visualisation is more playful and allows the user to explore it more flexibly this has the potential more the user to extract more understanding from it. Visualisation systems should be designed to allow the user to freely explore the data however this idea could conflict or clash with the intetion of the designer of the system. If a data visualisation is designed to get a certain message across or tell a specific story to the user this can mean that the way in which the data is allowed to be explored is limited.

            The reading then explores interaction in terms of human computer interaction outlining key points that characterise good interaction when it comes to HCI. Some of the points are similar the the points discussed above when taking about interaction just in terms of visualisation such as dialogue is somewhat similar to external actions, control and tool use are similar to external entities. The concept of transmission alines or is somewhat similar to the idea of internal actions in that they both have to do with the taking of information it seems that experience would also fit into the concept of internal actions. The reading however ponts out and suggests that when considering interaction for visualisations HCI’s points should be made to be more flexible inorder to account for the users possible intentions notably allowing the user to generate understanding over time while interacting with the visualisation.
        </p>

            The article stresses that interaction for visualisation should account for the users evolving goals and intentions in order to facilitate the creation of knowledge, the communicatio between the data through some sort of medium to the user should be done in a way that is easily accessible, the article also mentions how there are opportunities to create interactive visualisations that are fun and playful that utillise different technologies and occupy different spaces perhaps like creating visualisations that can be interacted with in a VR space would be an interesting example of this. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Interaction in terms of visalistions could be a very helpful way of generating understanding, an example that I found where this maybe extremly helpful is the use of ineractive visualisations within acedemic journals, incorporating interaction here could allow information to be more easily accessible. 
        </p>
       
        <h4>Notes on the actual reading itself:</h4>
        <p>
            One observation of the reading I had that I thought would be interesting to point out or rather it just really stuck out to me is that in the example scenarios given to illiterate interactivity all the persons where given male names and pronouns. I just thought it was important to notes as in the (section) a point is made that the user or persons interacting with the data should remain gender neutral. This bias towards male language just highlighted an issue discussed in DAT last semester.
