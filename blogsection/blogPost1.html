            Close Reading: Overview of Data Visualisation by Li Q
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Summary and reflection
        </h3>
        <p>
            Data visualisation concerns the representation of data in a visual form in order to make the data easier to understand, comprehend, explore and analyse. Representing data in this way can make it easier for people to see patterns and trends in the data allowing it then to be more easily understood. It allows for the knowledge present in the data to be communicated more effectively. The text outlines the advantages of data visualisation as it is able to represent large datasets quickly, it allows the easy identification of patterns, it allows for quality control and it can work to deepen the comprehension of the data being presented (Li Q 2020). Presenting data in this way can influence or help with decision making and overall just in how we view a certain dataset, it can be used to convey certain ideas. Data visualisation is used to visualise both information and scientific research. Data visualisation is the process by “which data in any form can be transformed into graphical images.”(Li Q, 2020 p19) 
        </p>

            Another area the reading focuses is on the idea of data versus the idea of information. Data exists as a raw form of information that is unorganised while information or secondary data is data that has been organised or processed that then illustrates some sort of meaning, it is data that we can then extract knowledge from. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The reading gives examples of the various forms that data can be represented in. A tree illustrates data or information in a hierarchical manner showing how each item relates to another. The example given to show the tree type illustrated form me and issues that could come about while representing data, that being that there is that there could be some bias in what information gets represented, as the example tree only focuses on European architecture styles and leaves out others or just briefly touches on them. The reading then talks about maps, charts, scatter plots, tables, diagrams and graphs which overlap, waveforms, simulations and volume. The last two are primarily used to represent scientific data.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The reading emphasises that it is important to consider what type of information you are representing or what information you wish to communicate when choosing the way you want to represent it or what form best aliens with your end goal. This aspect raised a few questions such as; is it possible to represent any dataset in all of the above forms? Are the various forms interchangeable? And what is the best way to go about choosing the right form? The reading kind of answers the last question by stating how the end result should fulfil certain criteria; it should present the information in a form that is readable, it should be easily recognizable or easily comprehensible and it should have, illustrate meaning or knowledge.(Li Q, 2020) 

        </p>
        <p>
            The reading then goes on to explore how human perception  needs to be considered and how perception affects how humans understand and interpret information. Perception allows humans to convert sensory data into understanding, it allows us to relate to the world around us. In a Ted talk about data visualisation David McCandless talks about why representing data visually may be an effective way of communicating the meaning within data and the reading as mentions something similar when it discusses preattentive processing and how our eyes can transmit large amounts of information effectively. This brought up a question of whether or not this way of data representation would be accessible to everyone as it releases heavily on a sense that not everyone may have or people whose sense of sight may be impaired. The reading briefly touches on the importance of design or aesthetics when it comes to data visualisation because it can allow for the data to be more readable and the pattern to be more identifiable or recognizable therefore more effectively communicating meaning and knowledge.
