        <h2>Data and Representation: a comparison of the strategies of representation used Data Art and Data Visualisation</h2>
        <p>
            Representation involves the use of signs and codes such as images or language to create meaning(Kidd, 2016). Through 
            representation we are able to construct meaning, create understanding for ourselves, each other and of reality. It 
            also allows us to communicate with those around us (especially in the case of language). In this essay we will explore 
            how data is represented in terms of standard data visualisations and data art. What strategies of representation each 
            form uses, how they differ and how they may be similar. In doing so it is important to take into consideration the 
            function or purpose of both forms of data representation as well as the context they exist in and the way they present data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes data visualisation and data art’s strategies of representation different largely has to do with the function each 
            form has.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data visualisation is conventionally used for the purpose of knowledge creation(Kidd, 2016). To create understanding 
            or insight into a particular set of data. It is used in professional settings such as finance, government, 
            journalism and well as various scientific fields as a tool to aid in the process of decision making. It is also used 
            to identify overarching patterns, recurring trends and relationships within a dataset. Data visualisation is used to 
            make large quantities of otherwise incomprehensible data easier to read and understandable to humans. Through the act 
            of visualising the data or representing the data the data is given meaning for humans to understand. It could be said 
            that through the creation of data visualisation the data’s meaning is constructed (Kidd, 2016) and can thus be understood 
            and analysed by humans in order to gain insight into an aspect of reality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Data art is characterised by the expression of a particular point of view (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007). The medium is 
            used to send a message using a dataset. Much like other more conventional forms of art the intent of a piece of data 
            art is to evoke an emotional response of sorts and instead of it giving meaning to a set of data it uses the data set 
            to say something about reality. It provides commentary on issues in a form that can appeal to the emotions as well as 
            the mind because of the way it utilises data. For example in the work “Why Harvard Doesn’t Fund Alternative Health 
            Care Research,” by Shojo (2001) something is being said about the structures of power within the USA's health care system 
            (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007), this work of data art , while identifying a pattern within the data, the main focus is on the message 
            being conveyed. The artwork appeals to the viewer's morals as well as evoking emotion(Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) when addressing 
            the issue of corporate power structures. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another aspect that should be noted and considered when discussing these different forms of data representation is 
            the actual dataset being used. In the case of Data Art the choice of data is made with the intent to convey a message, 
            in a sense the artist chooses and then sometimes distorts the data based on what they are trying to say. This is 
            different from Data Visualization where the data is chosen in order for it to be more clearly understood, the creator 
            tries to have as neutral of a voice as possible and presents the data with as minimal distortions as possible. So while 
            Data Art makes a point of clearly admitting its bias, Data Visualization attempts to have no bias or presents its bias 
            in a more subtle or subconscious way. The Viégas reading highlights this idea when it states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
            These distortions are not mistakes on the part of the artists. The value of the artworks rests on the fact that 
            their creators recognize the power of visualization to express a point of view. By contrast, traditional analytic 
            visualization tools have sought to minimize distortions, since these may interfere with dispassionate analysis. 
            (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007, 27) 

        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above it is important to consider how the data is being used. Data Art tries to evoke emotions 
            or create an experience for the viewer, it aims to make a statement using the data rather than communicating 
            or creating understanding using the data by presenting it in a way that makes it easier to view as is the case 
            with Data Visualisation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However it is only assumed that Data Visualization is unbiased or attempts to be unbiased due to “the context 
            that the image is used”(Kidd, 2016) in. The context or space where an image is found can influence and affect 
            how it is perceived and interpreted. Due to the spaces Data Visualisations are used in they are associated with 
            a myth of being neutral. It is assumed that Data Visualisations are concerned with offering neutral views of the 
            data because the purpose of a visualisation is seen to be to communicate the data in a more accessible way. Since 
            Data Art is viewed through the lens of being a work of art and exists within artistic spaces it is thought of and 
            analysed differently, it doesn’t exist under the expectation of being neutral because it is assumed that it is meant 
            to have some sort of meaning. It is judged and experienced in the same way art is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another aspect of data representation to consider is the way that each form goes about being constructed. 
            Data Visualisation is often constructed with a more rigid approach utilising theories, practices and conventions 
            of design in order to effectively communicate the data. Data Visualisation employs and re-uses common forms of 
            representation such as graphs, bar charts or scatter plots, in order to represent the data. The goal when visualising 
            data is to make it as easy to understand as possible therefore visualisation often uses simple symbols and codes to 
            indicate something about the data because of the fact that “their impact needs to be instantaneous”(Kidd, 2016, pg31). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important aspect of data visualisation to note is the idea of framing, because there are often large 
            quantities of data but it is important when designing an effective visualisation that the viewer doesn’t 
            become overwhelmed by the data they are being presented with, not all the data can be represented. 
            The designer makes a choice as to what aspect of the data are important or relevant. Framing also concerns 
            every other aspect of designing a data visualisation because the choice made has an impact on the way 
            that the data will then be understood. Through designing a data visualisation the designer can impose their 
            own bias or intentional which would influence how the data is seen and understood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data Art on the other hand can utilise more experimental methods of presenting the data for the 
            purpose of art. This is not to say that Data Art doesn’t utilise conventional means of data 
            visualisation but that it is not limited to the same design constraints as traditional Data 
            Visualisation. Some common forms of data artworks include data sculptures which use physical 
            materials to represent data or data sonification which uses sound to represent data (Benzi). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Both Data Visualisation as well as Data Art can be considered forms of techno-art
            (Janssens & Roeser, 2016) as they both can work to “help people to make abstract 
            problems concrete, explore new scenarios, challenge their imaginations” 
            (Janssens & Roeser, 2016, p130) they just do it for different purposes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Data visualisation uses conventional design principles, 
            theories and conventions to represent data in standardised 
            formats such as graphs or charts depending on what will best 
            communicate the data in a way that is easy to understand. Data 
            visualisation is thought to represent data in a way that is neutral 
            and unbiased however despite the intent to be unbiased data visualisation 
            can contain unintended bias, in some cases however the bias can be intentionally 
            it is important to be able to critically analyse data visualisation and keep in mind that everything 
            exists within context.
            On the other hand data art acts as a medium through which something is expressed whether that be an 
            emotion, comment on reality or simply a form of entertainment and it does this through the experimental 
            or unconventional representation of data.
