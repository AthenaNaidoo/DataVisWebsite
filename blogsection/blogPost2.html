            Critical reflection on UI and UX 

        </h2>
        <p>
            The main aim I wish to achieve with my website is to make it easy to understand, with a minimal design drawing inspiration from modern web design and easy to navigate using common conventions seen in websites. 
        
        <h3>Homepage </h3>

        </p>
        
        <p>
            At the top of the page there will be a navigation bar that links to the other pages. The nav bar will be dynamic so when the user scrolls down the nav bar will always be at the top of the page. The page will open with a welcome which briefly introduces the purpose of the website and also establishes the overall aesthetic of the website. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Scrolling further down the page the user will be shown a preview of the blog section's latest article with a button displaying read more which will take the user to the blog section. Further down there will be a preview of the data visualisation page with a brief description of the latest data visualisation. The reasoning behind these choices is because of the common conventions I’ve observed while looking at other website layouts. I think this format gives the user direction when entering the website and has the potential to minimise the amount of clicks. At a later state I think I will make a preview of each section on the homepage with a brief explanation. 

        </p>
        <h3>Blog Section</h3>

        <p>Instead of a navigation bar there will be a hamburger button that will then display the nav when it is clicked, it will remain fixed to the top left of the page. The blog posts will be displayed based on the date they were released going from the most recent post to the post that was posted first. This is a common format for blogs. Instead of displaying the full blog posts it will display the introduction with a button asking if the user wants to read the full post. 

        </p>
        <h3>Style Guide</h3>

        <p>
            The website will use minimal colour. Mostly being in black and white. As it will be a space themed website all the backgrounds will be black with white used for text. When there is a need for contrast the inverse will be used. 

        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            By using commonly used web design conventions I hope to make a website that’s really easy to navigate and understand.
