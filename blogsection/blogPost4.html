        <h2>Data driven art</h2>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Firstly when I started thinking about what I wanted to create or achieve with a data art piece, I wanted to consider how the viewer would experience the piece. 
            I wanted the viewer to experience it on the same level they would experience any other art piece. To achieve this I thought it would be a good idea to present 
            the data initially with no context (no axis or labels) just a title so that they could take in the artwork as sort of separate, allowing them to experience the 
            artwork on their own with no guidance or direction. I wanted the artwork to be pretty in some manner to the viewer or invoke a satisfied feeling as most data 
            visualisations do. In the “What is data art?” reading there is an emphasis put on the idea that data art is united by a “forceful point of view”
            ( Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) and while I wanted to direct the viewer's attention to specific aspects of the data I didn’t necessarily have any specific meaning
             that I wanted to convey.    
        </p>
        <p>
            A key idea I wanted to have in mind while creating the project was I still wanted the visualisation to provide the viewer with some sort of insight into the 
            dataset itself and for it to be set out in a way that was easy to understand.
        </p>
        <h3>Inspiration, research and planning</h3>
        <p>
            In this section I go over the inspirations, research and planning that went into coming up with my artwork and why I wanted to make certain decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the first artworks that come to mind when I was starting the project was a work by Gerhard Marx titled Weather ( Marx, 2011) which is a storm cloud 
            that is made up of plastic rulers, the work looks like a dense graph that showcases a large chunk of date to create the pattern of a cloud, I really like 
            the idea of taking a dataset and manipulating it to form a picture that showcases the data that it utilises in someway (in this case it would be taking
             weather data and raging it in a graph somehow to make it look like a cloud, I’m don’t think the artwork was actually constructed this way but it's what 
             my imagination ran with). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another data visualisation that gave me some inspiration was one done by the Outside in America team that deals with the transportation of homeless people 
            across the United States. This artwork was interesting because of how it directed the viewer through the data and how it effectively told a story through 
            data, even though it was complemented with an article viewers can gain insight purely from viewing the data visualisations. A reason I think the visualisations
             are so effective is due to the use of animation to tell a story.
            (This work is explanatory and doesn’t let the viewer explore the actual dataset or satisfy any questions they may have about the dataset, it doesn’t really 
            allow for any meaningful interaction but rather engages the user through the use of narrative and story.)
            That’s another aspect that I noticed about data art, usually the artist is the only one who gets to explore the actual data and the visualisation acts to
             focus the viewer's attention on a specific point of meaning.  

        </p>
        <h3>Idea, intent and data</h3>
        <p>
            I wanted to use the mars rover API specifically for opportunity using the data from its landing date and the data from the last day it was active. 
            Specifically I wanted to use the amount of photos it took on each day comparing the two. I wanted to create mirrored graph-like images comparing the 
            two in a static way as most of the data artworks given as examples in the “What is data art?”reading mainly showcased static images. I wanted to create an 
            image that would look something like this:
            <figure>
                <img src="/img/DraftOfArt.png" alt="rough sketch of Data art ">
                <figcaption>
                    (the image above is a rough idea featuring the two different iterations of the idea)
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
            The graph for the landing day would appear with the x and y axis switched while the death day 
            graph would mirror the landing data graph giving the viewer the chance to make a comparison of 
            the data. The main bar that encompasses all the other bars represents the total number of 
            pictures taken in the day while the smaller bars would represent how many of those photos 
            were taken by specific cameras. I decided rather than to go with a typical bar graph to go 
            with a waterfall bar graph instead as I think it will allow for a clearer interpretation of 
            the data, making it easier to compare as well as providing a more interesting visual
        </p>
        <p>
            With the colour palette of the graph I wanted to put an emphasis on the idea of beginnings 
            and endings, life and death, sunrise and sunset. 

            <figure>
                <img src="/img/colorsofLifeAndDeath.png" alt="colour pallet">
                <figcaption>
                    (image of the colour pallet)
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
            By representing the two days as mirrored and contrasting graphs 
            I hoped that the reader would gain insights into the data by 
            comparison, sticking to the idea that “visualisations are meant to enable inference and insights” (Riche et al., 2018) of some sort.
